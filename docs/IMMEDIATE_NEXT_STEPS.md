## 📊 Step 3: Baseline Metrics Snapshot

### 3.1 API Response Latencies

**Capture Method:**
```bash
# Automated latency capture
python3 scripts/lock_production_stability.py
```

**Metrics Captured:**
- ✅ Average response time per endpoint
- ✅ P95 and P99 latencies
- ✅ Success rates
- ✅ Error rates and types

**Target Metrics:**
| Endpoint | Target P95 | Target Success Rate |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| `/api/companies/*/summary` | < 200ms | > 95% |
| `/api/companies/*/trading` | < 200ms | > 95% |
| `/api/markets/quotes` | < 200ms | > 95% |
| `/api/health` | < 100ms | > 99% |

### 3.2 Data Quality Stats (81 Companies)

**Assessment Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent**: 90%+ data completeness, recent updates
- ✅ **Good**: 70-89% data completeness, recent updates
- ✅ **Fair**: 50-69% data completeness
- ✅ **Poor**: < 50% data completeness
- ✅ **No Data**: Missing or inaccessible

**Expected Distribution:**
```
Total Companies: 81
Companies with Data: 75+ (92%+)
Quality Distribution:
- Excellent: 25+ companies
- Good: 30+ companies
- Fair: 15+ companies
- Poor: 5+ companies
- No Data: < 6 companies
```

### 3.3 Real-time Update Performance

**Metrics Captured:**
- ✅ WebSocket connection latency
- ✅ Data update frequency
- ✅ Chart rendering performance
- ✅ Real-time data accuracy

**Performance Targets:**
- ✅ WebSocket connection: < 100ms
- ✅ Data update frequency: > 80% updates within 1s
- ✅ Chart rendering: < 2 seconds
- ✅ Real-time accuracy: 100% data consistency

## 📈 Step 4: Establish Performance Benchmarks

### 4.1 Baseline Metrics Storage

**Generated Files:**
```
baseline_metrics/
├── baseline_metrics_v1_0_0.json          # Complete metrics snapshot
├── api_latencies_v1_0_0.json            # API performance data
├── data_quality_v1_0_0.json             # Data quality assessment
├── realtime_performance_v1_0_0.json     # Real-time metrics
└── system_health_v1_0_0.json            # System health snapshot
```

**Key Metrics to Track:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX",
  "version": "v1.0.0",
  "api_performance": {
    "avg_response_time_ms": 150,
    "p95_response_time_ms": 180,
    "success_rate": 0.97
  },
  "data_quality": {
    "total_companies": 81,
    "companies_with_data": 75,
    "excellent_quality": 25,
    "good_quality": 30
  },
  "realtime_performance": {
    "websocket_latency_ms": 80,
    "update_frequency": 0.85,
    "chart_rendering_ms": 1500
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Performance Monitoring Setup

**Baseline Comparison:**
- ✅ Track API performance against v1.0.0 baseline
- ✅ Monitor data quality degradation
- ✅ Alert on performance regressions
- ✅ Validate real-time update performance

**Monitoring Alerts:**
```yaml
# Example monitoring thresholds
api_performance:
  p95_latency_threshold: 200ms  # 10% above baseline
  success_rate_threshold: 95%   # 2% below baseline

data_quality:
  companies_with_data_threshold: 70  # 5 below baseline
  excellent_quality_threshold: 20    # 5 below baseline

realtime_performance:
  websocket_latency_threshold: 100ms  # 20ms above baseline
  update_frequency_threshold: 80%     # 5% below baseline
```

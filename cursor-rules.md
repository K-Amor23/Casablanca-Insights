## 1. ‚ú® Coding Philosophy

- **Let Cursor write first.** You review and refine.
- **Prompt clearly**: define inputs, expected outputs, edge cases, and format.
- **Stay in flow**: use Cursor inline with file-specific prompts.

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è File & Code Generation Rules

- Always generate:
  - `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` files alongside logic-heavy components or utilities.
  - `zod` validation schemas or TypeScript interfaces for all external or unstructured data.
- Scraping/ETL scripts must include:
  - Logging of source URLs
  - Timestamp of data ingestion
  - Retry logic and exception handling

# Shared Package Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Casablanca Insights project to use a shared package for common functionality across web and mobile apps.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Shared Package Dependencies
- ✅ Added `@casablanca-insight/shared` to both web and mobile app dependencies
- ✅ Used relative file paths for workspace dependencies
- ✅ Installed dependencies successfully

### 2. Created Platform-Specific API Services
- ✅ Created `WebApiService` in `apps/web/lib/api.ts` extending `BaseApiService`
- ✅ Created `MobileApiService` in `apps/mobile/src/services/api.ts` extending `BaseApiService`
- ✅ Both services properly handle authentication headers for their respective platforms

### 3. Migrated SentimentVoting Components
- ✅ Updated web `SentimentVoting` component to use shared version with web-specific render functions
- ✅ Updated mobile `SentimentVoting` component to use shared version with mobile-specific render functions
- ✅ Both components now use the shared logic while maintaining platform-specific UI

### 4. Created Shared Utilities
- ✅ Created `apps/web/lib/utils.ts` that re-exports shared utilities
- ✅ Added web-specific utilities (`formatPercent`, `getColorForChange`)
- ✅ Migrated `SnapshotMetrics` component to use shared `formatCurrency` utility

### 5. Updated Shared Package Exports
- ✅ Updated `packages/shared/src/index.ts` to export all components, services, and types
- ✅ Built shared package successfully

## Architecture Benefits

### Code Reuse
- Shared business logic in `BaseApiService` and `SentimentVoting`
- Common utilities for formatting, validation, and calculations
- Shared TypeScript types across platforms

### Platform Flexibility
- Platform-specific render functions allow different UI implementations
- Authentication handled appropriately for each platform (Supabase for web, AsyncStorage for mobile)
- Maintains native look and feel for each platform

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for API contracts and business logic
- Easier to add new features across both platforms
- Consistent error handling and validation

## Next Steps for Further Migration

### 1. Continue Component Migration
- Migrate more components to use shared base classes
- Create shared components for common UI patterns
- Extract more business logic to shared package

### 2. API Service Enhancement
- Add more API methods to `BaseApiService`
- Implement caching and offline support
- Add request/response interceptors

### 3. Utility Consolidation
- Identify and migrate more duplicated utilities
- Create platform-specific adapters for storage, navigation, etc.
- Add more shared validation and formatting functions

### 4. Testing
- Add unit tests for shared components and utilities
- Create integration tests for API services
- Test cross-platform compatibility

## Migration Pattern

The successful migration follows this pattern:

1. **Extract shared logic** to the shared package
2. **Create platform-specific adapters** that extend shared base classes
3. **Use render props/function patterns** for platform-specific UI
4. **Re-export utilities** in platform-specific utils files
5. **Gradually migrate components** one by one

This approach maintains platform-specific functionality while maximizing code reuse and consistency.
